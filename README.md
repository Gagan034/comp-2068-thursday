A Movie Store

"Note - We created the whole project of movie store are are able to create, update, edit and delete. But when we added authentication, we are now unable to login, hence can't edit info. There are no errors shown though."

We all decided to review class lessons before we start working on our project. so we can help each other and make our project successful. 

We all came up to create this application which will contain all the requirements for the project and allows a user to view, add, movies whatever they like and it also allows a user to edit and delete it.

We decided to allocate time from our schedule so we can work and get this done. 

Gagan is good at working on code without error so she took responsibilities to write code. 

We (other 3) helped her to what to do in it. and also wrote the code whenever needed. 

Gagan has her Github and Heroku working so we decided to use her credentials to upload the project part one. 

Thong was helping other memebrs to get their work done.

Dhruvi and Dante uploaded assignment to github.

Each and every member were there, giving their contribution equally which helped a lot during this project completion. 

Dante, Thong and Dhruvi suggested how the application should go and Gagan double checked if it is appropriate and covers all necessary requirements. 

Reviewing our class learning was so helpful. 

After everyone's nearly 100% contribution we were able to do this.
